**NOTE** If you observe errors related to DNS issues, for example

```bash
127.0.1.1:53: cannot unmarshal DNS message
```

You may configure your system to use Google public DNS servers.
See corresponding [Linux](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#linux) and [Mac OS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#mac_os) instructions.
