The screenshot shows the basic configuration for establishing a connection between ThingsBoard and Kafka Broker. With these settings, the integration will request updates from the Kafka broker every 5 seconds. And if set a topic does not exist at the broker, it will be created automatically.
Note: With debug mode enabled, you can view errors, connection status and other events by opening the Events tab.
